## Init containers 

In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD's lifecycle.

For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'git clone  ;']

```

When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the application starts.

You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-containers pod. In that case, each init container is run one at a time in sequential order.


## Liveness and Readiness Probe 

Kubernetes supports self-healing applications through ReplicaSets and Replication Controllers. The replication controller helps ensure that a POD is re-created automatically when the application within the POD crashes. It helps in ensuring enough replicas of the application are running at all times.

Kubernetes provides additional support to check the health of applications running within PODs and take necessary actions through Liveness and Readiness Probes. However, these are not required for the CKA exam and as such, they are not covered here. These are topics for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developers (CKAD) exam and are covered in the CKAD course.
